# Push_Swap
Shuffling brilliance meets stack sorcery in 'push_swap' â€“ an ingenious C implementation from School 42 that sorts a stack of numbers with limited operations. Brace yourself for algorithmic wizardry and witness the mastery of order unfold!

# Push Swap Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Push Swap project! This repository showcases my implementation of the Push Swap algorithm, developed as part of my coursework at School 42. Push Swap is a remarkable sorting project that demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems using efficient algorithms and the C programming language.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the Push Swap project was to design and implement an algorithm that sorts a stack of numbers in ascending order, using only a limited set of stack operations. By completing this project, I aimed to demonstrate the following skills and qualities:

- Proficiency in the C programming language
- Understanding of algorithmic principles and efficiency
- Ability to manipulate and manage data structures, particularly stacks
- Problem-solving and critical thinking skills
- Attention to detail and code optimization
- Collaboration and adherence to project requirements

## Key Features and Highlights

### 1. Algorithmic Brilliance

In Push Swap, I employed a range of sorting algorithms, carefully selecting the most suitable ones to achieve optimal performance. The project pushed me to explore different strategies, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and implement a combination that delivered efficient sorting results.

### 2. Stack Mastery

Manipulating stacks was at the core of this project. By skillfully implementing stack operations such as swapping, pushing, and rotating, I demonstrated my ability to navigate data structures and leverage their power to solve complex sorting challenges.

### 3. Performance and Optimization

With a keen eye for efficiency, I optimized my code to minimize unnecessary operations and reduce computational overhead. This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in algorithmic optimization, ensuring that the sorting process was as fast and streamlined as possible.
